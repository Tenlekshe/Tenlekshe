-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tenzin Lekshey a beginner web developer.

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development

-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Freshman at NSUT

When it comes to server-side development, I'm still learning.
I like to create visually appealing websites and applications where users can easily find information. I am still exploring a variety of programming languages and trying to improve my communication skills.
